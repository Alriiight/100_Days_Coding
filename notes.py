# Math in python


#f-string is an efficient way to convert data types within a single line of code in order to print to console. Use the following example for clarification:

# bmi = 27
# height = 1.80
# weight = 88
# is_overweight = True

# print(f"your height is {height} meters, your weight is {weight} kilograms. This means your BMI index is {bmi}. You are overweight is {is_overweight}.")

# LOGICAL OPERATORS
# and (both need to be true), or (one or the other must be true), not.
