# Math in python


#f-string is an efficient way to convert data types within a single line of code in order to print to console. Use the following example for clarification:

# bmi = 27
# height = 1.80
# weight = 88
# is_overweight = True

# print(f"your height is {height} meters, your weight is {weight} kilograms. This means your BMI index is {bmi}. You are overweight is {is_overweight}.")

# LOGICAL OPERATORS
# and (both need to be true), or (one or the other must be true), not.

# RANDOM MODULE

# import random

# random_integer = random.randint(1, 10)
# print(random_integer)

# random_float = random.random()
# print(random_float)

# random_combined = random_integer + random_float
# print(random_combined)

# LISTS

states_of_america = ["Delaware", "Alabama", "Texas", "Pennsylvania"]
print(states_of_america[1])
# It is possible to have postive indecis and also negative ex. [-1].
