# 🚨 Don't change the code below 👇

# Reminder: height must be entered with decimal point, ex. 1.80

# Step 1: confirm data type of variables.
# print(type(height))
# print(type(weight))

# Step 2: convert height ('str') into float.

bmi = num_weight / fl_height**2

# Step 5: Convert result into int (float -> int). Print.

# bmi = int(weight) / float(height) ** 2
