# Step 1: confirm data type of variables.
# print(type(height))
# print(type(weight))

# Step 2: convert height ('str') into float.
fl_height = float(height)
# print(type(fl_height))

# Step 3: convert height ('str') into int.

# print(type(num_weight))

# Step 4: Execute formula and create new BMI variable
BMI = (num_weight / (fl_height**2))
